# SORTIE-Manuals
This is a repo for the complete user and developer documentation for SORTIE-ND. The files are all stored as HTML and if this is pulled down, it can be accessed through a browser from the "index" file in the root directory. This is not meant to be the primary way to access the manuals; they are available at http://www.sortie-nd.org/help/manuals/index.html and through the SORTIE-ND help system.
