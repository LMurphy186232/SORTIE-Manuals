<h1> What is a tree? </h1>


<p>
The basic unit of data in the model is the tree. A model tree is a collection of attributes describing one individual. The attributes include location in the <a href="../data/plot.html">plot</a>, species, <a href="tree_life_history_stages.html"> life history stage</a>, and size. Additional attributes are added as needed for the use of the particular set of <a href="what_is_a_behavior.html"> behaviors</a> in a run.
</p>
<p>
Location and species for a tree never change. <a href="tree_life_history_stages.html">Life history stage</a> transitions are handled automatically as a tree moves through its lifecycle. Tree size and shape are managed according to <a href="../data/allometry/index.html"> allometry</a> settings. Behavior-specific attributes are managed by the appropriate behavior.
</p>
<p>
You work with these attributes when you select data for <a href="output_trees.html"> output</a> or work with tree maps when setting up <a href="tree_initial_conditions.html"> run initial conditions</a>.
