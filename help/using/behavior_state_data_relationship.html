<h1>Relationship of behaviors to trees and grids</h1>

<p>
<a href="what_is_a_tree.html">Trees</a> and <a href="what_is_a_grid.html">grids</a> are the <a href="modeling_concepts.html"> state data</a> of SORTIE. Behaviors act on this data to change it and evolve the model state.
</p>
<p>
Behaviors are assigned to specific data, and may not act outside this scope.
</p>
<p>
SORTIE directly manages all the state data needed for a given simulation and automatically ensures the creation of any data that a behavior is assigned to work on. Users can adjust the initial conditions of all state data at the beginning of the simulation.
