<h1>How trees are organized - the tree population</h1>

<p>Trees are organized by location and size in what is called the tree population. The tree population divides up the plot into 8 m by 8 m grid cells, and tracks the trees in each cell by height.
</p>
<p>
The tree population is where the list of tree species is defined. It tracks all of the <a href="../data/allometry/index.html">allometry</a> relationships for each of these species and manages <a href="tree_life_history_stages.html">life history stage</a> transitions and attribute updates for individual trees.
