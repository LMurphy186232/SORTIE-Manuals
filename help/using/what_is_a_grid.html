<h1>What is a grid?</h1>
<p>
A grid is a structure for holding model data that varies across space. It contains cells, organized by row and column, that cover the entire plot. Grids are part of the <a href="modeling_concepts.html"> state data</a> of SORTIE.
</p>
<p>
Examples of grids are soil fertility (substrate), storm damage susceptibility maps, and number of seeds dispersed.
</p>
<p>
A single grid can be set up to hold more than one value per cell. In addition, packets of information called packages can be attached to individual cells to add to the amount of information a grid can carry. There is no limit to the number of packages that can be attached to a cell. An example of data which might come in packages is a grid holding data on harvest events, with each package representing a discrete harvest.
