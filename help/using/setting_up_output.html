<h1>Setting up output</h1>
<p>
You should set up output last, after you have completed your parameter file. What data you will have available to save will depend on how you have chosen to set up your run.
</p> 
<p>
To set up output, choose <a href="../windows/output_setup_window.html">"Edit->Output options"</a> from the main SORTIE window. This will lead you to windows that allow you to choose what you want to save for both summary and detailed output files. Your options will depend on the setup of the run.
</p>
<p>
If you are working with a parameter file that was created on a different computer or by someone else, remember to check the file path and name of the output files. You may need to change the path to one that exists on the computer on which you intend to run the parameter file.
