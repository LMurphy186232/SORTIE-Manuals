<h1>Types of output files</h1>
<p>
There are two kinds of output files, <a href="../files/short_output_files.html">summary output files</a> and <a href="../files/detailed_output_files.html">detailed output files</a>. You can save either or both kinds of files for a run. 
</p>
<p>
Summary output files save high-level plot-wide density and basal area information for a run. This data is stored in a text format that is small and easy to open and read.
</p>
<p>
Detailed output files save information on individual grades and trees. They are very flexible. You can save as much or as little detail as you like. You cannot directly open and read these files, but you can use SORTIE to graph and chart the data and produce a wide variety of text output from the files.
