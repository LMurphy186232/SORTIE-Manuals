<h1>Grid output</h1>

<p>
Grid data can only be saved in a <a href="types_of_output.html">detailed output file</a>. If a grid stores multiple types of data, you can choose which ones you want to save. For the chosen pieces of data, the output file contains the value for each cell.
</p>
<p>
Saved grid data can be viewed as a map or a histogram or can be used as initial conditions input for a new run.
