<h1>How grids are created and used</h1>
<p>
Which grids are used for a run depends entirely on which <a href="what_is_a_behavior.html"> behaviors</a> are used. All grids are created automatically by a behavior. A grid that is not needed in a run will not be created.
</p>
<p>
Behaviors use grids for three primary reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To map spatial variation in some aspect of the plot (as with a storm damage susceptibility map)</li>
<li>To pass information from behavior to behavior (as with a substrate map which is updated by one behavior and used by another to determine likelihood of seed establishment)</li>
<li>To report something for output (number of trees harvested, amount of biomass)
</ul>
