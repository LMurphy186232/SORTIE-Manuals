<h2>Data license</h2>
<p>
You may use the SORTIE-ND software for any purpose, including the creation of data for publication in a scientific book or journal.  One of the primary goals of scientific experiments is replicability of results.  Therefore, if you have modified the SORTIE-ND software, you may not publish data from it using the names "SORTIE" or "SORTIE-ND" unless you do one of the following:  1) send a copy of the source code of your changes back to the SORTIE-ND team at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies for inclusion in the standard version or 2) publish enough detail about your changes so that they could be replicated by a reasonably proficient programmer.
