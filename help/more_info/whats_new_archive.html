<h2>Version 7.0 beta</h2>
<p>
There have been some big changes in the inner workings of SORTIE-ND to allow more flexibility and function. These changes have been extensively tested but until they get used day-to-day, we know problems can still appear. Therefore we decided to officially release version 7.0 as a beta. Please report all problems to tech support and we will resolve them as quickly as possible.
