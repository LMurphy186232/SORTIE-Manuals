<h1>DBH - diameter at 10 cm relationship</h1>
<p>
Seedlings use the diameter at 10 cm as their primary indicator of size, and have no DBH.  Saplings use both DBH and diam<sub>10</sub>. The use of both measurements by saplings helps to maintain continuity between the seedling and adult life history stages.  Adults use only DBH.
</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Intercept of DBH to Diameter at 10 cm Relationship</td><td> The intercept of the linear relationsip between the DBH, in cm, and the diameter at 10 cm height, in cm, in small trees. Used by all species.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Slope of DBH to Diameter at 10 cm Relationship</td><td> The slope of the linear relationship between the DBH, in cm, and the diameter at 10 cm height, in cm, in small trees. Used by all species.</td></tr>

</table>
<p>
DBH and diam<sub>10</sub> are related as follows:
</p>
<center><i>DBH = (diam<sub>10</sub> * R) + I</i></center>
<p>
where
</p> 
<ul>
<li><i>DBH</i> is the DBH in cm</li>
<li><i>diam<sub>10</sub></i> is the diameter at 10 cm height, in cm</li>
<li><i>R</i> is the <b>Slope of DBH to Diameter at 10 cm Relationship</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>I</i> is the <b>Intercept of DBH to Diameter at 10 cm Relationship</b> parameter</li>
</ul>
