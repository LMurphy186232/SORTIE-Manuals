<h1>Seasonal Water Deficit</h1>
<p>
This behavior changes the value of the <a href="../plot.html#parameters">Seasonal Water Deficit</a> parameter of the SORTIE plot in response to changes in the mean annual temperature and precipitation of the plot. Seasonal water deficit is the difference between potential evapotranspiration in the presence of limitless water and actual evapotranspiration based on available precipitation. As such, it is an index of the degree to which actual supply of moisture fails to meet "demand" for moisture. This assumes that monthly temperature and rainfall patterns do not change along with changes in mean annual temperature and precipitation.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The first step is calculating monthly temperature and precipitation based on the latest values for the plot.  
</p>
<center><i>T<sub>i</sub> = T * RT<sub>i</sub></i></center>
<p>
</p>
<center><i>P<sub>i</sub> = P * RP<sub>i</sub></i></center>
<p>
where: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>T<sub>i</sub></i> is temperature, in degrees C, for month i</li>
<li><i>P<sub>i</sub></i> is precipitation, in mm, for month i</li>
<li><i>P</i> is the annual precipitation, in mm</li>
<li><i>T</i> is the mean annual temperature, in degrees C </li>
<li><i>RT<sub>i</sub></i> is the <b>Ratio of [month i] Temp to Annual Temp</b> parameter </li>
<li><i>RP<sub>i</sub></i> is the <b>Proportion of Precipitation in [month i]</b> parameter </li>
</ul>
<p>
Then PET (monthly potential evapotranspiration) is calculated as:
</p>
<center><i>PET<sub>i</sub> = 0.013 * (T<sub>i</sub>/(T<sub>i</sub>+15) * (R<sub>s</sub>+50)</i></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>PET<sub>i</sub></i> is monthly potential evapotranspiration in mm</li>
<li><i>T<sub>i</sub></i> is monthly temperature in degrees C</li>
<li><i>R<sub>s</sub></i> is the <b>[month i] Radiation (cal/cm2)</b> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>
If <i>T<sub>i</sub></i> &le; 0, then <i>PET<sub>i</sub></i> = 0.
</p>
<p>
In order to calculate actual evapotranspiration, we need monthly soil moisture values. Monthly soil moisture storage is calculated as:
</p>
<center><i>sms<sub>i</sub> = 0 &lt; sms<sub>i-1</sub> + precip<sub>i</sub> - PET<sub>i</sub> &lt; MaxAWS</i></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>sms<sub>i</sub></i> is the soil moisture, in mm, for the current month</li>
<li><i>sms<sub>i-1</sub></i> is the soil moisture, in mm, for the previous month</li>
<li><i>precip<sub>i</sub></i> is the monthly precipitation (mm) for the current month</li>
<li><i>PET<sub>i</sub></i> is potential evapotranspiration for the current month</li>
<li><i>MaxAWS</i> is the <b>Available Water Storage in Top 100 cm Soil</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
It is assumed that the soil is saturated on the last day of the year, so for January, <i>sms<sub>i-1</sub></i> = <i>MaxAWS</i>.
</p>
<p>
Monthly actual evapotranspiration (AET) is calculated as:
</p>
<center><i>AET<sub>i</sub> = sms<sub>i</sub> + precip<sub>i</sub></i></center> 
<p>if <i>sms<sub>i+1</sub></i> &le; 0, or</p>
<center><i>AET<sub>i</sub> = PET<sub>i</sub></i></center>
<p>
if <i>sms<sub>i+1</sub></i> &gt; 0.
</p>
<p>
Annual AET is the sum of the monthly AET values, and annual PET is the sum of the monthly PET values; and Seasonal Water Deficit = PET - AET.
</p>
<p>
This value is then given to the <a href="../plot.html">Plot</a> object which makes it available to other behaviors in the run.  </p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
Add this behavior to the run.  You do not need to assign this behavior to trees.
