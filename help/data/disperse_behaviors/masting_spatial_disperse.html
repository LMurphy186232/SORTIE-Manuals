<h1>Masting spatial disperse behavior</h1>

<p>
This behavior is a variant of the <a href="non_gap_spatial_disperse.html">Non-gap spatial disperse</a> behavior that adds masting and more stochasticity in seed production.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
<b>Deciding when to mast.</b> For each timestep, the probability of masting for each species is calculated from the following cumulative distribution function:
</p>
<center><img src="../data_files/mastcdf_equation.gif"></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>y</i> is the probability of masting</li>
<li><i>X</i> is the number of years since last mast</li>
<li><i>a</i> is the <b>Masting Disperse - Masting CDF "a"</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>b</i> is the <b>Masting Disperse - Masting CDF "b"</b> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>
When the run starts, it is assumed a masting last event took place in timestep -1. A random number is used to determine whether a mast occurs in the current timestep. Disperse happens the same way in mast and non-mast timesteps, but the parameters used are different.
</p>
<p>
Species may be organized into groups to create synchrony in masting. The <b>Masting Disperse - Masting Group</b> parameter allows you to assign group numbers to species. The actual value of the group number is not important. It only matters if more than one species has the same number. If one species in a group masts, all species in that group do. Each group's mast decision is made separately, so sometimes more than one group may mast at a time. If all species have a different group number, then they all mast independently of one another.
</p>
<p>
<b>Which trees disperse.</b> Of the group of trees eligible to disperse (those with DBHs above the value in the <b>Minimum DBH for Reproduction, in cm</b> parameter), some can be randomly selected to participate in disperse. The proportion dispersing is set in <b>Masting Disperse - Mast Proportion Participating (0-1)</b> for mast timesteps, and <b>Masting Disperse - Non-Mast Proportion Participating (0-1)</b> for non-mast timesteps. The group of trees participating is chosen again each timestep. No adjustment is made to the number of seeds produced per tree. Fewer trees participating in disperse means fewer total seeds will be produced.
</p>
<p>
<b>STR stochasticity.</b> The STR value may be randomized each timestep. Use the <b>Masting Disperse - STR Draw PDF</b> parameter to choose from a normal or lognormal probability distribution. You can then set the mean and standard deviations for each species, which are different in masting and non-masting timesteps. You can also leave the STR value deterministic, in which case the mean STR value is used directly.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to use a stochastic STR, the STR value can be generated once per species per timestep, or once per tree per timestep. If the value is generated once per species, all individuals of that species use the same STR value that timestep.
</p>
<p>
Once the behavior has decided whether masting occurs, and what the STR values are, then disperse proceeds exactly as described in the <a href="non_gap_spatial_disperse.html">Non-gap spatial disperse</a> behavior.
</p>


<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
Apply this behavior to all trees of at least the minimum reproductive age for your chosen species. If the minimum
reproductive age is less than the <a href="../../using/tree_life_history_stages.html">Minimum adult DBH</a>, be sure to apply this behavior to saplings as well as adults.
