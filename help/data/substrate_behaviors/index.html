<h1>Substrate behaviors</h1>

<p>
Substrate is what seedlings germinate in - soil, rock, and the organic layers on top.  The quality of the substrate can make a big difference in a seedling's ability to survive and establish.  The substrate composition in any one place is constantly shifting and changing as new substrate is added to the forest floor and as existing substrate decays.  These behaviors keep track of the substrate conditions at different locations through time.
