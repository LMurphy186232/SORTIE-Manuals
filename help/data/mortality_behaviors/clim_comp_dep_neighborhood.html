<h1>Climate and Competition Dependent Neighborhood Survival</h1>
<p>
This behavior assesses tree survival as a function of mean annual temperature, water deficit, and neighbor adult basal area.  For efficiency, it calculates survival rates for cells in a grid and assigns trees the survival probability of the grid cell in which they are found.    
</p>
<p>
Trees killed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "natural".

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
This behavior uses the <a href="../grids/clim_comp_dep_surv_grid.html">Climate Comp Dep Neighborhood Survival</a> grid to keep track of survival rates. The annual probability of survival for a given species and given grid cell is calculated as: 
</p>
<center><img src="../data_files/clim_comp_dep.gif" alt="surv eq exp(-A*BAT^B)*exp(-0.5*(((T-M)/N)^2))*exp(-0.5*(((WD-C)/D)^2))"></center>
<p>where: </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Surv</i> is the annual probability of survival </li>
<li><i>A</i> is the <b>Climate Comp Dep Neighborhood Surv - A</b> parameter </li>
<li><i>B</i> is the <b>Climate Comp Dep Neighborhood Surv - B</b> parameter </li>
<li><i>M</i> is the <b>Climate Comp Dep Neighborhood Surv - M</b> parameter </li>
<li><i>N</i> is the <b>Climate Comp Dep Neighborhood Surv - N</b> parameter </li>
<li><i>C</i> is the <b>Climate Comp Dep Neighborhood Surv - C</b> parameter </li>
<li><i>D</i> is the <b>Climate Comp Dep Neighborhood Surv - D</b> parameter </li>
<li><i>T</i> is the mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius as entered in the <a href="../plot.html">Plot </a></li>
<li><i>T</i> is the water deficit as entered in the <a href="../plot.html">Plot </a></li>
<li><i>BAT</i> is the adult total basal area in the neighborhood, in square meters </li>
</ul>
<p>
BAT is the basal area of all adults within the distance from the center of the grid cell set in the <b>Temp Dependent Neighborhood Surv - Neigh Search Radius (m)</b> parameter.  
</p>
<p>
The probability of survival is for a single year.  For multi-year timesteps, the timestep survival probability is the annual probability raised to the power of the number of years per timestep. 
</p>
<p>
Trees receive the survival probability calculated for the grid cell in which they are found.  A random number is used to determine whether a tree lives or dies.    
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species.
