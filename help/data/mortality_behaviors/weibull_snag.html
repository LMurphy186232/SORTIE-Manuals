<h1>Weibull snag mortality behavior</h1>
<p>
This behavior controls <a href="../../using/tree_life_history_stages.html">snag</a> fall.  Snags are standing dead trees.  Obviously, they can't die again, so the word "mortality" is a bit of a misnomer.  We call the behavior a mortality behavior because it functionally fits in this behavior class.  
</p>
<p>
Snags that are "killed" by this behavior are considered to have fallen over.  If <a href="../substrate_behaviors/index.html">Substrate behaviors</a> are enabled, then these fallen trees are available to become new fresh log substrate.  Any that are not picked up by substrate will be dealt with by the <a href="../dead_tree_behaviors/index.html">Dead tree remover</a> behavior. 
</p>
<p>
Trees killed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "natural".

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The behavior uses a Weibull function to determine the number of snags of a certain age left standing at a given time.  The equation is:
<p>
<center><img src="../data_files/weib_snag_mort.gif"></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>S</i> is proportion of snags still standing, between 0 and 1
<li><i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are Weibull parameters (<b>Weibull Annual "a" Parameter for Snag Size Class X Mortality</b> parameter and <b>Weibull Annual "b" Parameter for Snag Size Class X Mortality</b> parameter)
<li><i>T</i> is the snag age in years
</ul>
<p>
Different sizes of snags fall at different rates.  This behavior allows you to define three snag size classes and enter different "a" and "b" parameters for each.
</p>
<p>
A random number is used against this equation for a given tree to determine if it falls in the current timestep.
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to snags of any species.
