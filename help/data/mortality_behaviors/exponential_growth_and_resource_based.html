<h1>Exponential Growth and Resource-Based Mortality</h1>
<p>
This behavior calculates probability of mortality as a function of growth and some second resource.  The identity of the second resource is unimportant and could be anything, from exchangeable calcium levels to soil moisture.
</p>
<p>
Trees killed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "natural".
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The probability of mortality for a tree is calculated with the following equation:
</p>
<center><i>Prob = (d + a * R) * exp( -( b + c * R) * G)</i></center>
where:
<ul>
<li><i>Prob</i> is the annual probability of mortality, as a value between 0 and 1</li>
<li><i>R</i> is the amount of the second resource</li>
<li><i>G</i> is the amount of radial growth, in mm/yr</li>
<li><i>a</i> is the <b>Exponential Growth-Resource - a</b> parameter - the mortality at zero growth scaled as a function of the resource R</li>
<li><i>b</i> is the <b>Exponential Growth-Resource - b</b> parameter - the light dependent mortality</li>
<li><i>c</i> is the <b>Exponential Growth-Resource - c</b> parameter - the resource dependent mortality</li>
<li><i>d</i> is the <b>Exponential Growth-Resource - d</b> parameter</li>
</ul>

<p>
The amount of the second resource is captured in a grid object called <a href="../grids/resource_grid.html">Resource</a>.  Currently it is up to you to enter a map of the values for this resource grid; for instructions on how to do this, see the <a href="../../windows/grid_setup_window.html">Grid Setup Window</a> topic.  This behavior does not in any way alter the values in this grid.
</p>
<p>
The mortality probability as calculated above is an annual probability. For multi-year timesteps, the timestep probability is 1 - (1 - AP)<sup>X</sup>, where AP is the annual probability and X is the number of years per timestep. Once a tree's timestep survival probability has been calculated, it is compared to a random number to determine whether the tree lives or dies.

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species. Any tree species/type combination to which it is applied must also
have a <a href="../growth_behaviors/index.html">growth behavior</a> applied. You must also enter a map of second resource values into the <a href="../grids/resource_grid.html">Resource</a> grid.
