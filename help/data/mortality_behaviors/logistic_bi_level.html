<h1>Logistic bi-level mortality</h1>

<p>
This behavior calculates the probability of survival according to a logistic equation, with the possibility of two sets of parameters for each species:  one for high-light conditions and one for low-light conditions.  This can also be used alone without the light levels.
</p>
<p>
Trees killed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "natural".
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The equation used by this behavior to calculate survival probability is:
</p>
<br><center><img src="../data_files/logit_eq.gif" alt="Logistic Bi-Level Mortality Equation"></center><br>
<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>p</i> - annual probability of survival</li>
<li><i>a</i> - in high-light conditions, this is the <b>Logistic Bi-Level - High-Light "a"</b> parameter; in low-light conditions, this is the <b>Logistic Bi-Level - Low-Light "a"</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>b</i> - in high-light conditions, this is the <b>Logistic Bi-Level - High-Light "b"</b> parameter; in low-light conditions, this is the <b>Logistic Bi-Level - Low-Light "b"</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>D</i> - tree diam, in cm; diam<sub>10</sub> for seedlings, DBH for others</li>
</ul>
<p>
If the timestep length is not one year, the actual probability of survival for the timestep is calculated as <i>p' = p<sup> T</sup></i>, where <i>p</i> is the annual probability of survival, <i>p'</i> is the timestep probability of survival, and <i>T</i> is the number of years per timestep.  Once the survival probability for the timestep is known for a tree, then a random number is compared to this probability to determine if the tree lives or dies.
</p>
<p>
Light levels come from the <a href="../grids/storm_light_grid.html">Storm Light</a> grid produced by the <a href="../light_behaviors/storm_light.html">Storm Light</a> behavior.  The threshold between the use of high-light and low-light parameters is set in the <b>Logistic Bi-Level - High-Light Mortality Threshold (0-100)</b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
This behavior can also be used without Storm Light.  In this case, only the low-light mortality parameters are used.
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species.  If you wish to use the light-level parameter switch, also use the <a href="../light_behaviors/storm_light.html">Storm Light</a> behavior.
