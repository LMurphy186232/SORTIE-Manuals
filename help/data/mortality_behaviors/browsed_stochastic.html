<h1>Browsed Stochastic Mortality</h1>
<p>
This simulates the effects of herbivory by allowing different background mortality rates for browsed and unbrowsed trees.
</p>
<p>
Trees killed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "natural".
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td class="parname">Background Mortality Rate</td><td> The proportion of trees that die each year, as a value between 0 and 1.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Browsed Background Mortality Rate</td><td> The proportion of browsed trees that die each year, as a value between 0 and 1.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
Whether or not a tree is browsed is determined by the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/random_browse.html">Random browse</a> behavior. For each tree, if it has not been browsed, that species's <b>Background Mortality Rate</b> parameter is used; if it has been browsed, the species's <b>Browsed Background Mortality Rate</b> parameter is used. A random number is compared to the appropriate rate to decide if the tree dies.</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species. Any tree species/type combination to which it is applied must also have the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/random_browse.html">Random browse</a> behavior applied.
