<h1>Self thinning</h1>
<p>
Self-thinning is a behavior that uses a pseudo-density dependent function designed to increase the death rate in dense uniform-age stands. You specify a maximum DBH at which to apply it - above this DBH a tree will not die.
</p>
<p>
Trees killed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "natural".
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Self-Thinning Intercept</td><td> Intercept of the self-thinning linear function. </td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Self-Thinning Slope</td><td> Slope of the self-thinning linear function. </td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Maximum DBH for Self-Thinning</td><td> Maximum DBH at which self-thinning applies. Above this value, no mortality occurs. </td></tr>

</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
Self-thinning uses a simple linear function of probability of mortality as a function of DBH, assuming the tree is below the maximum DBH at which to apply self-thinning. After evaluating this function for a tree, it uses a random number to determine whether the tree dies.
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species.
