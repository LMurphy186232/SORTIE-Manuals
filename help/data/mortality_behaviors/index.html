<h1>Mortality behaviors</h1>
<p>
The mortality behaviors cause tree death due to natural life cycle causes and competition. Tree death due to disturbance is covered by other behaviors.
</p>
<p>Mortality behaviors do not actually remove dead trees from memory. They set a flag which marks trees as dead. This is because some other behaviors, such as the <a href="../substrate_behaviors/index.html">Substrate</a> group, have specific interest in dead trees. Dead trees are eventually removed from memory by the <a href="../dead_tree_behaviors/index.html">Dead tree remover</a> behavior. You may notice this behavior in your behavior list. It is included automatically. It is important to include this behavior in your run to avoid incorrect results in behaviors that use dead trees and unacceptably slow model run times.

<tr><td class="behname"><a href="aggregated.html">Aggregated Mortality</a></td><td>Kills trees randomly to match a predetermined mortality rate, clumping together the deaths in both time and space.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="behname"><a href="bc.html">BC Mortality</a></td><td>Kills trees as a function of growth rate.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="behname"><a href="browsed_stochastic.html">Browsed Stochastic Mortality</a></td><td>Simulates the effects of herbivory by allowing different background mortality rates for browsed and unbrowsed trees.</td></tr>
