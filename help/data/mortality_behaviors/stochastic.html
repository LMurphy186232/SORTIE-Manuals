<h1>Stochastic mortality</h1>
<p>
This behavior produces a background mortality rate. Individuals within the pool of trees to which this behavior applies are randomly selected to die.
</p>
<p>
Trees killed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "natural".
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td class="parname">Background Mortality Rate</td><td> The proportion of trees that die each year, as a value between 0 and 1.</td></tr>

</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
For each tree, a random number is compared to that species's <b>Background Mortality Rate</b> parameter to determine if it falls in the pool of trees that die.
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species.
