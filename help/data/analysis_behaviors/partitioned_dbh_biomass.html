<h1>Partitioned DBH Biomass</h1>

<p>
This behavior calculates biomass as a linear function of DBH, partitioned into leaf, branch, and bole biomass.
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The mass of all components is calculated using the same equation, but using different parameters.  The equation is:
</p>
<center><i>Bio<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i</sub> * DBH + b<sub>i</sub></i></center>
<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Bio<sub>i</sub></i> = biomass in kg dry weight of the component in question</li>
<li><i>a<sub>i</sub></i> = the "a" parameter for the component</li>
<li><i>b<sub>i</sub></i> = the "b" parameter for the component</li>
<li><i>DBH</i> = tree's DBH in cm
</ul>
<p>
The amount of each type of biomass, in metric tons, for each species is saved in a grid called <a href="../grids/partitioned_biomass_grid.html">Partitioned Biomass</a>.  You can save these values in a detailed output file for analysis. You of course can skip any of the components by entering 0's for their parameter values.
</p>


<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>Apply this behavior to saplings, adults, or snags of any species. <em>This behavior does not automatically create output.</em> Once you have added this behavior to your run, the <a href="../../windows/detailed_output_grid_setup.html">Detailed output grid setup window</a> will list the <a href="../grids/partitioned_biomass_grid.html">Partitioned Biomass</a> grid. You can then view the contents of this grid as a <a href="../../data_visualization/tables.html">table</a> using SORTIE's data visualization system.
