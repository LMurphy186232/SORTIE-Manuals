<h1>Partitioned Height Biomass</h1>

<p>
This behavior calculates biomass as a linear function of tree height, partitioned into leaf and bole biomass.
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th</tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Partitioned Height Biomass - Leaf Slope (a)</td><td> The slope in the linear biomass equation for leaves. </td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Partitioned Height Biomass - Leaf Intercept (b)</td><td> The intercept in the linear biomass equation for leaves. </td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Partitioned Height Biomass - Bole Slope (a)</td><td> The slope in the linear biomass equation for boles. </td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Partitioned Height Biomass - Bole Intercept (b)</td><td> The intercept in the linear biomass equation for boles. </td></tr>

</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The biomass of leaves and boles is calculated using the same equation, but using different parameters.  The equation is:
</p>
<center><i>Bio<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i</sub> * Height + b<sub>i</sub></i></center>
<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Bio<sub>i</sub></i> = biomass in kg dry weight of either leaves, branches, or the bole</li>
<li><i>a<sub>i</sub></i> = either the <b>Partitioned Height Biomass - Leaf Slope (a)</b> or <b>Partitioned Height Biomass - Bole Slope (a)</b> parameters</li>
<li><i>b<sub>i</sub></i> = either the <b>Partitioned Height Biomass - Leaf Intercept (b)</b> or <b>Partitioned Height Biomass - Bole Intercept (b)</b> parameters</li>
<li><i>Height</i> = tree's height in meters
</ul>
<p>
The amount of each type of biomass, in metric tons, for each species is saved in a grid called <a href="../grids/partitioned_biomass_grid.html">Partitioned Biomass</a>.  You can save these values in a detailed output file for analysis. 
</p>


<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>Apply this behavior to saplings, adults, or snags of any species. <em>This behavior does not automatically create output.</em> Once you have added this behavior to your run, the <a href="../../windows/detailed_output_grid_setup.html">Detailed output grid setup window</a> will list the <a href="../grids/partitioned_biomass_grid.html">Partitioned Biomass</a> grid. You can then view the contents of this grid as a <a href="../../data_visualization/tables.html">table</a> using SORTIE's data visualization system.
