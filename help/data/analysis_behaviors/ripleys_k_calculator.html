<h1>Ripley's K Calculator</h1>

<p>
This behavior calculates the Ripley's K function for all trees in the plot as well as for the members of each species.
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th</tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Ripley's K - Maximum Distance (m)</td><td> The maximum distance out to which to calculate K values. </td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Ripley's K - Distance Increment (m)</td><td> The distance increments at which K will be calculated. Smaller increments mean a smoother curve but also more processing time. </td></tr>

</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The Ripley's K function is a measure of the way trees are spatially distributed across the plot. K values are calculated repeatedly for a succession of distances out to a maximum, giving a curve. The Ripley's K statistic for a given distance t is calculated as:
</p>
<center><img src="../data_files/ripleys_k_eq.gif" alt="K equals AX over n squared"></center>
<p>
where: 
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>K(t)</i> is the K value at distance t</li>
<li><i>A</i> is the plot area in square meters</li>
<li><i>X</i> is the number of pairs of trees in the plot less than t meters apart</li>
<li><i>n</i> is the total number of trees in the plot</li>
</ul>
<p>
The size of the distance increment is given in the <b>Ripley's K - Distance Increment (m)</b> parameter. The maximum distance out to which to calculate K is given in the <b>Ripley's K - Maximum Distance (m)</b> parameter. Most Ripley's K formulas come with a term for edge correction, which is not needed in SORTIE-ND as the plot has no edges. (See <a href="../plot.html">the SORTIE-ND Plot</a> topic for more on the plot's shape.)
</p>
<p>
Only saplings and adult trees are included in K calculations.
</p>
<p>
The K values are calculated for all trees in the plot as well as for individual species. In the case of an individual species, X is the number of pairs of trees of that species, and n is the total number of trees of that species.
</p>
<p>
The resulting K values are stored in the <a href="../grids/ripleys_k_grid.html">Ripley's K</a> grid.

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>Add this behavior to your run. There is no need to apply it to specific tree species or types. Indeed, any such specifications will be ignored. <em>This behavior does not automatically create output.</em> Once you have added this behavior to your run, the <a href="../../windows/detailed_output_grid_setup.html">Detailed output grid setup window</a> will list the <a href="../grids/ripleys_k_grid.html">Ripley's K</a> grid. Save all the data members of this grid. You can then view the K values as a <a href="../../data_visualization/line_graphs.html">line graph</a> and use the graph to save the K values as a text file.
