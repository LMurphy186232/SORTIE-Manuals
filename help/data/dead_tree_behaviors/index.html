<h1>Mortality utility behaviors</h1>
<p>This type of behavior performs cleanup by removing dead trees from memory at the appropriate time. This function is very important - if it did not occur, then the model would slow exponentially as memory filled up and those behaviors that look at recently dead trees would start getting strange results.
