<h1>Dead tree remover</h1>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>This behavior looks for the death flag as set by the <a href="../mortality_behaviors/index.html">mortality behaviors</a>. For each tree that it finds with that flag, it sends a request to the tree population to "kill" the tree. The reason passed to the tree population for the death of the tree is natural death.</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>This behavior should be applied to all tree species and tree types.</p>
