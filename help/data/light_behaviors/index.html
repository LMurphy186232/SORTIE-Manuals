<h1>Light behaviors</h1>

<p>
Light is the key resource for trees in the SORTIE model. Consequently, great care is taken in SORTIE to calculate the amount of light that each tree gets - in fact, these calculations take up more processing time than any other during model runs.
</p> 
<p>
There are two basic light index types used by SORTIE to describe the amount of light a tree receives. The first is the Global Light Index, or GLI. GLI is the percentage of full sun received at a point. The second index is the Sail Light index, which is the proportion of shade seen at a point, from none to total. (The name Sail Light comes from the fact that the shape of shading neighbor tree crowns is approximated by a 2D rectangle, like a sail).
