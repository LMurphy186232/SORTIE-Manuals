<h1>Storm Light behavior</h1>
<p>
This behavior calculates light levels as a function of number of trees damaged in <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/index.html">storms</a>.  Light levels are stored in a grid for later retrieval by other behaviors; this behavior does not directly assign light to trees. 
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
This behavior uses a <a href="../../using/what_is_a_grid.html">grid</a> called <a href="../grids/storm_light_grid.html">Storm Light</a> to manage light levels.  Each timestep, it calculates the light level at the center of each grid cell and places it in the grid.
</p>
<p>
The light level is calculated as follows:
</p>
<center><i>GLA = ((1 - T/M) * 100) + (a + b * N)</i></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>GLA</i> is the light level, as a value between 0 and 100</li>
<li><i>T</i> is the number of adult trees and snags within the search radius</li>
<li><i>M</i> is the <b>Storm Light - Minimum Trees For Full Canopy</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>a</i> is the <b>Storm Light - Intercept of Light Function</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>b</i> is the <b>Storm Light - Slope of Light Function</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>N</i> is the proportion of trees that are dead or were heavily damaged in recent storms</li>
</ul>
<p>
This behavior calculates the light levels at the center of each grid cell by examining the trees within the distance given in the <b>Storm Light - Max Radius (m) for Damaged Neighbors</b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
The first term in the equation, <i>((1 - T/M) * 100)</i>, corrects the light level if the point is not under full canopy.  All adults and snags, no matter what storm damage, are counted up and assigned to T.  If T &gt;= M, then the first term is set to 0 and only the second part, <i>(a + b * N)</i>, is evaluated.  If T &lt; M, then the first term adds to the linear portion the proportion of full sun equal to the proportion of trees missing from the full canopy.  
</p>
<p>
For the second, linear term, the behavior counts the number of dead and heavily damaged trees as a proportion of all adults and snags.  Trees count as heavily damaged if they are either snags that were created as a result of a storm killing an adult tree, or live adults with heavy storm damage.  All storm damaged trees have a time-since-damage counter; only those eligible trees with a counter value less than or equal to the value in the <b>Storm Light - Max Years Damaged Trees Affect Light</b> parameter are counted.  Saplings and seedlings never count.  All snags count, whether they were created by a tree or another mortality process. Their age as a snag must also be less than the <b>Storm Light - Max Years Snags Affect Light</b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
The GLA value can be used as-is, or it can be used as the mean in a PDF to introduce a stochastic element. You can choose either "Normal" or "Lognormal" in the <b>Storm Light - Stochasticity</b> parameter, then supply a standard deviation in the <b>Storm Light - Standard Deviation</b> parameter. Using "Deterministic" as the stochasticity causes the GLA to be used as-is.
</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
You do not need to apply this behavior to individual trees.  While it is recommended that you also include the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/index.html">Storm damage applier</a> behavior in your run, this is not required.
