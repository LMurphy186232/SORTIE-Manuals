<h1>Basal Area Light behavior</h1>
<p>
This behavior calculates light levels as a function of the basal area of trees in a neighborhood.  The light levels are randomized using a lognormal probability distribution.  Because of this random element, to ensure some continuity through time, light levels only change when the local neighborhood tree basal area has changed by a certain amount.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
This behavior uses a <a href="../../using/what_is_a_grid.html">grid</a> called <a href="../grids/ba_light_grid.html">Basal Area Light</a> to manage light levels.  Light levels are calculated for each cell in the grid; trees to which this behavior are assigned receive the light level of the cell in which they are located.
</p>
<p>
The behavior begins by calculating the total basal area and angiosperm basal area in the neighborhood of each Basal Area Light grid cell. The neighborhood is a circle with its center on the center of the grid cell, and a radius given in the <b>Basal Area Light - Search Radius for Neighbors (m)</b> parameter. Whether a neighborhood tree  counts as angiosperm or conifer depends on what its species is set to in the <b>Basal Area Light - Species Type</b> parameter.  Seedlings and snags are never included in these basal area totals.  Other trees are only included if their DBH is equal to or greater than the value set in the <b>Basal Area Light - Minimum DBH for Trees</b> parameter.  Once the basal areas are calculated, the behavior adds them together to create a total basal area, and compares this value to the previous timestep's total basal area.  If the value has not changed by more than the amount set in the <b>Basal Area Light - Minimum BA Change for New GLI (m2)</b> parameter, no further action is taken.  The previous timestep's GLI and basal area values are kept.
</p>
<p>
For each grid cell in which a new GLI is to be calculated, a mean GLI value is calculated as follows:
</p>
<center><img src="../data_files/ba_light_mean_gli.gif" alt="Mean GLI from basal area"/></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>GLI<sub>m</sub></i> is the mean GLI value, as a value between 0 and 100</li>
<li><i>a</i> is the <b>Basal Area Light - Mean GLI "a" Parameter</b></li>
<li><i>b<sub>a</sub></i> is the <b>Basal Area Light - Angiosperm "b" Parameter </b></li>
<li><i>c<sub>a</sub></i> is the <b>Basal Area Light - Angiosperm "c" Parameter</b></li>
<li><i>BA<sub>a</sub></i> is the angiosperm basal area for that grid cell, in square meters</li>
<li><i>b<sub>c</sub></i> is the <b>Basal Area Light - Conifer "b" Parameter </b></li>
<li><i>c<sub>c</sub></i> is the <b>Basal Area Light - Conifer "c" Parameter</b></li>
<li><i>BA<sub>c</sub></i> is the conifer basal area for that grid cell, in square meters</li>
</ul>
<p>
This mean GLI is translated into a &#950; value for the lognormal random draw as follows:
</p>
<center><i>&#950; =  ln(GLI<sub>m</sub>) - (&#963; <sup>2</sup>/2)</i></center>
<p>
where <i>GLI<sub>m</sub></i> is the mean GLI value calculated above, and <i>&#963; </i> is the <b>Basal Area Light - Lognormal PDF Sigma</b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
This value is then used to produce a random lognormally distributed number, from the following distribution:
</p>
<center><img src="../data_files/lognormal_pdf.gif" alt="Lognormal function"></center>
<p>
where <i>&#950; </i> is the value calculated above, and <i>&#963; </i> is the <b>Basal Area Light - Lognormal PDF Sigma</b> parameter.  This number is the GLI value, between 0 and 100.
</p>
<p>
Once each Basal Area Light grid cell has gotten a GLI value, trees to which this behavior applies get the value of GLI from the grid cell in which they are located. 
</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior may be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species.
