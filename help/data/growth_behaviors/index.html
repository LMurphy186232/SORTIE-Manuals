<h1>Growth behaviors</h1>

<p>Growth behaviors change the size of a tree. A tree has two basic size dimensions:  diameter and height.  A growth behavior can change the tree size dimensions using one of two methods.  
</p>
<p>
In the first method, the behavior calculates an amount of diameter change, and then adds this amount to the tree's diameter.  The tree's new height is calculated from the new diameter using the appropriate <a href="../allometry/index.html">allometry equation</a>.  This is the default method.  Behaviors using this method have the tag "diam with auto height" in their name.
</p>
<p>
In the second method, diameter change and height change are calculated separately by two different behaviors. Behaviors that operate on diameter and height independently must be paired together. Behaviors using this method have the tag "diam only" or "height only" in their names.
</p>
<p>
When incrementing a tree's diameter with new growth, seedlings and saplings have the amount of growth change applied to their diameter at 10 cm. Adults have the amount applied to their DBH. For more on tree types and their measurements, see the <a href="../../using/tree_life_history_stages.html">tree life history stages</a> topic. For more on tree size relationships, including how trees transition between life history stages, see the <a href="../allometry/index.html">allometry</a> topic.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note: All behaviors convert growth to diameter growth in cm for internal consistency.  The equations below reflect this.  Some behaviors may take parameters in mm, or for radial growth.  Take careful note of your behavior's parameters.</b>
</p>
<p>
It is important to be careful when using different behaviors for height and diameter growth. The values are not required to conform to the tree's <a href="../allometry/index.html">allometry equation.</a> This may create trees whose dimensions are no longer linked with an allometric function. This is not considered a problem, although it may have unintended effects. For instance:  if tree seedlings or saplings get separate diameter and height increments, then their diameters and heights will be "uncoupled."  This means that you cannot use one of the size dimensions to predict the other through an allometric equation.  Trees with the same diameter will have different heights, and vice versa. If  you assign the adults to a behavior that increments diameter and then automatically updates height according to the allometry equations, you are likely to notice strange results for new adult trees.  You will lose the variability in height/diameter ratio that was developed.  Suddenly, all trees with the same diameter will have the same height again, and vice versa.  This means that individuals may suddenly jump in height, or even shrink.  
</p>
<p>
The "Allometric height growth" and "allometric diameter growth" behaviors were developed to help bridge this gap. When used with a behavior that only increments diameter or height, they will preserve height or diameter differences that have developed across individuals in a species.
