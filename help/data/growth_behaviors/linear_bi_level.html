<h1>Linear bi-level growth</h1>
<p>
This behavior increments growth according to a simple linear equation, with the possibility of two sets of parameters for each species:  one for high-light conditions and one for low-light conditions.  This can also be used alone without the light levels.
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The equation used by this behavior to increment growth is:
</p>
<center><i>Y = (a + b * diam) * T</i></center>
<p>
where
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Y</i> = amount of diameter growth in cm</li>
<li><i>a</i> = growth intercept; in high-light conditions, this is the <b>Linear Bi-Level - Intercept for High-Light Growth (a)</b> parameter; in low-light conditions, this is the <b>Linear Bi-Level - Intercept for Low-Light Growth (a)</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>b</i> = growth slope; in high-light conditions, this is the <b>Linear Bi-Level - Slope for High-Light Growth (b)</b> parameter; in low-light conditions, this is the <b>Linear Bi-Level - Slope for Low-Light Growth (b)</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>diam</i> = diameter (diameter at 10 cm for seedlings and saplings, DBH for adults)</li>
<li><i>T</i> = number of years per timestep</li>
</ul>
<p>
Light levels come from the <a href="../grids/storm_light_grid.html">Storm Light</a> grid produced by the <a href="../light_behaviors/storm_light.html">Storm Light</a> behavior.  The threshold between the use of high-light and low-light parameters is set in the <b>Linear Bi-Level - Threshold for High-Light Growth (0 - 100)</b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
This behavior can also be used without Storm Light.  In this case, only the low-light growth parameters are used.
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species.  If you wish to use the light-level parameter switch, also use the <a href="../light_behaviors/storm_light.html">Storm Light</a> behavior. You can use either the diam with auto height or diam only version.
