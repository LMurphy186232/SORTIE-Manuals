<h1>Constant basal area growth</h1>

<h3>Parameters for these behaviors</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Adult Constant Area Growth in sq. cm/yr</td><td> The constant amount of basal area by which to increase a tree's basal area.</td></tr>

</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The amount of diameter increase is calculated from a constant basal area increment.  The increase is calculated as follows:</p>
<center><i>Y = (g / diam) * 100 * T</i></center>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Y</i> is the amount of diameter increase, in cm</li>
<li><i>g</i> is the <b>Adult Constant Area Growth in sq. cm/yr</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>diam</i> is the tree's diameter, in cm</li>
<li><i>T</i> is the number of years per timestep </li>
</ul> 
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species. Any tree species/type combination to which it is applied must also have a <a href="../light_behaviors/index.html">light behavior</a> applied.  You can use either the diam with auto height or diam only version.</p>
