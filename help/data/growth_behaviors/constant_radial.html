<h1>Constant radial growth</h1>

<h3>Parameters for these behaviors</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Adult Constant Radial Growth in mm/yr</td><td> The constant value by which to increase a tree's radius at breast height.</td></tr>

</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
The amount of diameter increase is calculated from the constant radial increment.  The increase is calculated as follows:
</p>
<center><i>Y = (g<sub>4</sub> / 10) * 2 * T</i></center>
<p>
where
</p> 
<ul>
<li><i>Y</i> is the amount of diameter growth, in cm, to add to the tree</li>
<li><i>g<sub>4</sub></i> is the <b>Adult Constant Radial Growth in mm/yr</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>T</i> is the number of years per timestep</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that the increment parameter specifies <b>radial</b> growth; the behavior makes all necessary conversions to diameter growth.
</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>This behavior can be applied to seedlings, saplings, and adults of any species. Any tree species/type combination to which it is applied must also have a <a href="../light_behaviors/index.html">light behavior</a> applied.  You can use either the diam with auto height or diam only version.</p>
