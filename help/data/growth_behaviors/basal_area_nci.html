<h1>Basal area NCI growth</h1>
<p>
This behavior uses the effects of neighbor competitiveness to influence growth rates ("NCI" stands for neighborhood competition index).  In this case, the NCI is based on the basal area of neighboring trees.  A tree's maximum potential growth rate is reduced due to competitiveness and several other possible factors.

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>
For a tree, the amount of growth per year is calculated as:
</p>
<center><i>Growth = Max Growth * Size Effect * Crowding Effect</i></center>
<p>
Max Growth is the maximum diameter growth the tree can attain, in cm/yr, entered in the <b>NCI Maximum Potential Growth, cm/yr</b> parameter.  <i>Size Effect</i> and  <i>Crowding Effect</i> are factors which act to reduce the maximum growth rate and will vary depending on the conditions a tree is in.  Each of these effects is a value between 0 and 1.
</p>

<p>
<i>Size Effect</i> is calculated as:
</p>
<center><img alt="NCI size effect equation" src="../data_files/nci_size_effect.gif"></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>DBH </i>is of the target tree, in cm</li>
<li><i>X<sub>0</sub></i> is the <b>NCI Size Effect Mode, in cm (X0)</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>X<sub>b</sub></i> is the <b>NCI Size Effect Variance, in cm (Xb)</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Crowding Effect</i> is calculated as:
</p>
<center><i>CE = exp(-C * (DBH <sup>&#947;</sup> * BA<sub>n</sub> / BADiv) <sup>D</sup>)</i></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>C</i> is the <b>NCI Crowding Effect Slope (C)</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>DBH</i> is of the target tree, in cm</li>
<li><i>&#947;</i> is the <b>NCI Size Sensitivity to NCI (gamma)</b> parameter for the target tree's species</li>
<li><i>D</i> is the <b>NCI Crowding Effect Steepness (D)</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>BA<sub>n</sub></i> is the sum of the basal areas, in square cm, of eligible neighbors</li>
<li><i>BADiv</i> is the <b>Basal Area NCI - BA Divisor</b> parameter</li>
</ul>

<p>
When calculating BA<sub>n</sub>, this behavior uses neighbors of all species out to the distance set in the <b>NCI Max Radius of Crowding Neighbors, in m</b> parameter. The neighbors must have a DBH larger than the values set in the <b>NCI Minimum Neighbor DBH, in cm</b> parameter. If the <b>Basal Area NCI - Use Only Larger Neighbors</b> parameter is set to true, they must also have a DBH larger than the target tree's DBH. Seedlings and snags never contribute to BA<sub>n</sub>.
</p>
<p>
The amount of growth is in cm/year. For multi-year timesteps, the behavior will calculate total growth with a loop. Each loop iteration will increment DBH for one year. For each year, any portion of the growth equation with DBH as a term is recalculated with the previous year's updated DBH value. (NCI values are constant throughout this loop - for neighbors, only the d10 at the start of the timestep is used.)
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
This behavior can be applied to saplings and adults of any species. It cannot be applied to seedlings. You can use either the diam with auto height or diam only version.
