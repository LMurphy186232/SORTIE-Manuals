<h1>DetailedSubstrate Grid</h1>
<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../substrate_behaviors/detailed_substrate.html">Detailed Substrate behavior</a>.  The grid holds the relative proportions of the various substrate types.  If the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/harvest.html">Harvest behavior</a> is present for the run, then this grid's resolution must match the Harvest Results grid.  Otherwise, it defaults to a cell resolution of 8 m X 8 m, which you can change.  This grid holds <a href="../../using/what_is_a_grid.html">packages</a> with a different data structure from the main grid to track Substrate cohorts.
