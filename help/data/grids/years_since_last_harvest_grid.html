<h1>Years Since Last Harvest Grid</h1>

<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../growth_behaviors/lagged_post_harvest_growth.html">Lagged post harvest growth</a> and <a href="../mortality_behaviors/post_harvest_skidding.html">Post Harvest Skidding Mortality</a> behaviors.  Each grid cell holds the time since a harvest last occurred in that cell.  The grid cell resolution defaults to 8 m X 8 m. You can set whatever new resolution you wish.
