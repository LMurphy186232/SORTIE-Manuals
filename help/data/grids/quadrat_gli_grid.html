<h1>Quadrat GLI Grid</h1>
<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../light_behaviors/quadrat_based_gli.html">Quadrat-based GLI Light</a> behavior.  The grid holds a GLI value in each cell ("quadrat" being a term previously used in SORTIE to describe small grid cells).  The grid cell resolution defaults to 2 m X 2 m. You can set whatever new resolution you wish.
</p>

<h3>Data in the grid</h3>

<th>Data member name</th><th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td>GLI</td><td>GLI value, or -1 if there were no trees to which to assign a GLI value in that grid cell</td>
</tr>
