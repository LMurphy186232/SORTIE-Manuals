<h1>Foliar Chemistry Grid</h1>

<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../analysis_behaviors/foliar_chemistry.html">Foliar Chemistry</a> behavior. This is where the amount of different foliar chemistry components is stored.  All data is stored raw, no conversion to per-hectare amounts.</p>

<p>The grid cell resolution is set to 8 m X 8 m.  You can change this to whatever you wish.</p>
