<h1>Competition Harvest Results Grid</h1>

<p>
This grid is created by the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/competition_harvest.html">Competition Harvest behavior</a>. This is where data on competition harvest results is stored. The data is stored raw - no conversion to per-hectare amounts.
</p>
<p>
The default grid cell resolution is set to one grid cell for the entire plot. You can set whatever new resolution you wish.
</p>
