<h1>Resource Grid</h1>

<p>This grid holds values for a second growth resource for use by the <a href="../growth_behaviors/double_resource_relative.html">Double resource relative growth</a> and <a href="../mortality_behaviors/growth_and_resource_based.html">Growth and Resource-Based Mortality</a> behaviors.  The actual identity of the resource is unknown and unimportant.  The grid holds a value for resource level in each cell and it is assumed that the units scale appropriately to the parameters for the growth behavior.  The grid cell resolution defaults to 8 m X 8 m. You can set whatever new resolution you wish.
</p>

<h3>Data in the grid</h3>

<table class="gridlist">
<tr>
<th>Data member name</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Resource</td><td>Resource amount, in whatever units are appropriate</td>
</tr>
</table>
