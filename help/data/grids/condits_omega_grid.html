<h1>Relative Neighborhood Density Grid</h1>
<p>This grid holds values for the Relative Neighborhood Density (&#937;) statistic as calculated by the <a href="../analysis_behaviors/relative_neighborhood_density_calculator.html">Relative Neighborhood Density Calculator</a> behavior. The grid holds an &#937; value for each distance increment for each species. This can be a great many values. The grid cell resolution is always set to one cell covering the entire plot. You cannot change this.

<h3>Data in the grid</h3>

<table class="gridlist">
<tr>
<th>Data member name</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Max Distance</td><td>Maximum distance to which to calculate &#937;, in meters. Including this in the output is not necessary but will improve the SORTIE graphing capability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Distance Inc</td><td>How often to calculate &#937;, in meters. Including this in the output is not necessary but will improve the SORTIE graphing capability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Species X Dist Y Omega Value</td><td>The &#937; value for Species X at the Yth distance increment. This is not necessarily the distance in meters.</td>
</tr>
