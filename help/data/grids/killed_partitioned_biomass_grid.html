<h1>Storm Killed Partitioned Biomass Grid</h1>

<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../analysis_behaviors/storm_killed_partitioned_dbh_biomass.html">Storm Killed Partitioned DBH Biomass</a> and <a href="../analysis_behaviors/storm_killed_partitioned_height_biomass.html">Storm Killed Partitioned Palm Biomass</a> behaviors. This is where the amount of biomass is stored, partitioned into leaf, bole, and branch (if applicable) biomass.  All data is stored raw, no conversion to per-hectare amounts.</p>

<p>The grid cell resolution is set to 8 m X 8 m.  You can change this to whatever you wish.  The grid is shared by the two behaviors mentioned above, so changing it for one changes it for both.</p>

<h3>Data in the grid</h3>
