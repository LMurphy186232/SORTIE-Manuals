<h1>Partitioned Biomass Grid</h1>

<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../analysis_behaviors/partitioned_dbh_biomass.html">Partitioned DBH Biomass</a> and <a href="../analysis_behaviors/partitioned_height_biomass.html">Partitioned Palm Biomass</a> behaviors. This is where the amount of biomass is stored, partitioned into leaf, bole, and branch (if applicable) biomass.  All data is stored raw, no conversion to per-hectare amounts.</p>

<p>The grid cell resolution is set to 8 m X 8 m.  You can change this to whatever you wish.  The grid is shared by the two behaviors mentioned above, so changing it for one changes it for both.</p>
