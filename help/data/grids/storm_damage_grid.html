<h1>Storm Damage Grid</h1>

<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/storm_disturbance.html">Storm disturbance</a> behavior.  Each grid cell holds a storm damage index between 0 and 1.  The grid resolution default is 8 m X 8 m.  You can change this to whatever you wish, but if you are also using the grid <a href="storm_susceptibility_grid.html">Storm Susceptibility</a>, the resolutions must match.
</p>
