<h1>Substrate favorability Grid</h1>

<p>
This grid is created by either the <a href="../establishment_behaviors/substrate_dependent_seed_survival_no_gap_status.html">Substrate Dependent Seed Survival No Gap Status</a> or the <a href="../establishment_behaviors/substrate_dependent_seed_survival_with_gap_status.html">Substrate Dependent Seed Survival With Gap Status</a> behavior.  It holds the proportion of seeds expected to germinate on the substrate composite of the grid cell.  The cell resolution must match the "Substrate" grid, above.
