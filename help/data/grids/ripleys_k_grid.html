<h1>Ripley's K Grid</h1>

<p>This grid holds values for the Ripley's K statistic as calculated by the <a href="../analysis_behaviors/ripleys_k_calculator.html">Ripley's K Calculator</a> behavior. The grid holds a K value for each distance increment for each species. This can be a great many values. The grid cell resolution is always set to one cell covering the entire plot. You cannot change this.
</p>

<h3>Data in the grid</h3>

<table class="gridlist">
<tr>
<th>Data member name</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Max Distance</td><td>Maximum distance to which to calculate K, in meters. Including this in the output is not necessary but will improve the SORTIE graphing capability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Distance Inc</td><td>How often to calculate K, in meters. Including this in the output is not necessary but will improve the SORTIE graphing capability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All Species Dist Y K Value</td><td>The K value for all plot trees at the Yth distance increment. This is not necessarily the distance in meters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Species X Dist Y K Value</td><td>The K value for Species X at the Yth distance increment. This is not necessarily the distance in meters.</td>
</tr>
