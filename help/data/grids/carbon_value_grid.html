<h1>Carbon Value Grid</h1>
<p>
This grid is created by the <a href="../analysis_behaviors/carbon_value.html">Carbon Value behavior</a>.  It holds the amount of carbon and the value of that carbon for each species.  This grid has one cell for the whole plot.  It will ignore any changes you make to the resolution. If this grid's data is saved in a detailed output file, you can view the contents of this grid as a <a href="../../data_visualization/tables.html">table</a> using SORTIE's data visualization system.
