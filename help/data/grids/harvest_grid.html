<h1>Harvest Results Grid</h1>

<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/harvest.html">Harvest behavior</a>. This is where data on harvest results is stored. The data is stored raw - no conversion to per-hectare amounts. </p>

<p>The grid cell resolution is always set to match the <a href="harvest_master_cuts_grid.html">Harvest Master Cuts</a> grid. Any changes you make to the grid cell resolution will be ignored.</p>
