<h1>GLI Map [X] Grid</h1>
<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../light_behaviors/gli_map_creator.html">GLI Map Creator</a> behavior.  The grid holds a GLI value in each cell.  The grid cell resolution defaults to 8 m X 8 m. You can set whatever new resolution you wish.
</p>

<p>
Each instance of this grid's name ends with a number, i.e. "GLI Map 3". This is because it is possible to have more than one instance of these in a run. The number corresponds to the position in the behavior list of the parent behavior that created each grid, so they can be distinguished. 
</p>

<table class="gridlist">

<th>Data member name</th><th>Description</th>
