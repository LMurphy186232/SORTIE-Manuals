<h1>Mortality Episode Results Grid</h1>

<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/episodic_mortality.html">Episodic Mortality behavior</a>. This is where data on planned mortality episode results is stored. The data is stored raw - no conversion to per-hectare amounts. </p>

<p>The grid cell resolution is always set to match the <a href="mort_episode_master_cuts_grid.html">Mortality Episode Master Cuts</a> grid. Any changes you make to the grid cell resolution will be ignored.</p>

<h3>Data in the grid</h3>
