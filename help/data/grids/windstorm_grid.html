<h1>Windstorm Results Grid</h1>

<p>
This grid is created by the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/windstorm.html">Windstorm behavior</a>.  It holds information on what windstorms happened during each timestep.  This grid has one cell for the whole plot.  It will ignore any changes you make to the resolution. 
</p>
<p>
The data is held in grid packages.  There is one package for each storm event.  No package means no storms.  If this grid's data is saved in a detailed output file, you can view the contents of this grid as a <a href="../../data_visualization/tables.html">table</a> using SORTIE's data visualization system. 
</p>

<h3>Data in the grid</h3>
