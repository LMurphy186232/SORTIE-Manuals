<h1>Mortality Episode Master Cuts Grid</h1>

<p>This grid is created by the <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/episodic_mortality.html">Episodic Mortality behavior</a>. This is where directions to SORTIE for planned mortality episodes for the run are stored. The actual name of the grid is "mortepisodemastercuts".</p>

<p>The only thing you may change in this grid is the grid cell resolution. You may set it to anything you wish. You can change it with either the <a href="../../windows/grid_setup_window.html">Grid Setup</a> window (accessible only if planned mortality episode events have already been created) or with the <a href="../../windows/edit_mortality_episode_window.html">Edit Mortality Episode Window</a>.</p>

<h3>Data in the grid</h3>
<p>There is no user accessible data in the grid.</p>
