<h1>Storm direct killer</h1>

<p>
This behavior kills trees based on storm severity, without an intervening damage step. 
</p>
<p>
Trees removed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "storm".
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Storm Direct Killer - a</td><td> The "a" value in the probability of mortality logit function.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Storm Direct Killer - b</td><td> The "b" value in the probability of mortality logit function.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
When storms occur, trees to which this behavior are applied have the following probability of mortality:
</p>
<center><img src="../data_files/logit_eq.gif" alt="p equals exp(a + b * D) / (1 + exp(a + b * D)))"></center>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>p</i> is the tree's probability of mortality, between 0 and 1</li>
<li><i>a</i> is the <b>Storm Direct Killer - a</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>b</i> is the <b>Storm Direct Killer - b</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>D</i> is the storm damage at the tree's location</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once the mortality probability has been calculated, this behavior uses a random number to determine whether it lives or dies. If more than one storm has occurred in the current timestep, each storm gets a separate, independent chance to kill trees. 
</p>
<p>
Trees that die have a "dead" flag set to true and are treated in the rest of the run like trees that have died due to natural mortality. 
</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
Apply this behavior to the trees that can be killed in storms. You must also use the <a href="storm_disturbance.html">Storm disturbance</a> behavior and have any kind of <a href="../mortality_behaviors/index.html">mortality behavior</a> applied to each tree species and life history stage to which this behavior is applied.
