<h1>Selection harvest</h1>

<p>
This behavior allows you to specify target basal areas for a tree population as a method of harvest input, instead of designing specific harvest events.
</p>
<p>
Trees removed by this behavior will have a mortality reason code of "harvest".
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
You can specify up to four DBH ranges.  You provide the lower and upper DBH bounds of these ranges, and the target amount of basal area for each.  Each timestep, this behavior calculates the amount of basal area in each of these ranges.  If it is greater than the target, this behavior signals to the Harvest behavior that it should remove enough basal area to bring each range back down to its target basal area.  Since Harvest actually does the tree removal, see that behavior's documentation for the method used.  If the amount of basal area in any given range is less than the target, no trees are cut in that range.
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
Add this behavior to your run.  Harvest is also needed in the run, and should be placed after Selection Harvest in the behavior order.
