<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
This behavior is used together with the <a href="functional_response_seed_predation_linked.html">Functional response seed predation behavior (linked)</a> behavior. The two behaviors work together to model seed predation. 
</p>
<p>
The actual amount of seed eaten is calculated by the <a href="functional_response_seed_predation_linked.html">Functional response seed predation behavior (linked)</a> behavior. This behavior then distributes the offtake according to neighborhood composition.
</p>
<p>
The behavior begins by calculating the Y values for each grid cell as in the non-linked version (masting is ignored - there is only one set of parameters). Then the Y values are adjusted so that their mean is equal to the amount of whole-plot offtake Z as calculated by the <a href="functional_response_seed_predation_linked.html">Functional response seed predation behavior (linked)</a>. The adjustments are made as follows: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Calculate logit(Z)</li>
<li>Calculate the logit(Ys) and subtract the minimum value from each (as well as the logit(Z)) so they will all be positive</li>
<li>Average the logit(Y)s</li>
<li>Divide logit(Z) by average logit(Y) to get a correction factor</li>
<li>Multiply each logit(Y) by the correction factor</li>
<li>Add back the same minimum value formerly subtracted</li>
<li>Back transform logit(Y) to Y and use when removing seeds</li>
</ol> 
<p>
Then the seeds are removed according to the adjusted Y values.
</p>
<p>
This behavior can be used in the same run with the non-linked version of this behavior. The two sets of species are kept completely separate, and there are two separate sets of parameters.
</p>
<p>
This behavior may be applied to seeds of any species.  Any species to which it is applied must also have a <a href="../disperse_behaviors/index.html">Disperse behavior</a> applied, as well as the <a href="functional_response_seed_predation_linked.html">Functional response seed predation behavior (linked)</a>. This behavior should be placed after that behavior in the ordered list of model behaviors.
</p>
<p>
In order to make results more verifiable, Neighborhood Seed Predation produces a grid called <a href="../grids/neigh_seed_pred_grid.html">Neighborhood Seed Predation</a>. This grid stores the pre predation seed rain and amount of seeds eaten for each cell in the <a href="../grids/dispersed_seeds_grid.html">Dispersed Seeds</a> grid.  This grid has no effect on calculations but can be saved in the output file for review.
