<h1>Establishment behaviors</h1>

<p>
Establishment behaviors assess seed survival and create new seedlings from seeds.  Establishment behaviors do not create or distribute the seeds.  The <a href="../disperse_behaviors/index.html">Disperse behaviors</a> perform that function.
</p>
<p>
The seed survival behaviors act to reduce the number of seeds based on various environmental effects.  They can be used alone or in combination.  Once they have completed their work, the number of surviving seeds can be turned into seedlings by either the <a href="seed_establishment.html">Seed Establishment</a> or <a href="establishment_with_microtopography.html">Establishment with Microtopography</a> behaviors.
