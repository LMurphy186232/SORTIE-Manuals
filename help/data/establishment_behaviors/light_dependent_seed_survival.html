<h1>Light Dependent Seed Survival</h1>

<p>
This behavior assesses seed survival as a function of the Global Light Index (GLI) of the location in which a seed lands.  Light level calculations can take into account the change in light blocking by snags and trees with storm damage, if desired.

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The effects of light levels on seed survival is graphed as:<br>
</p>
<center><img src="../data_files/gli_estab_diagram.gif" alt="Light dependent seed survival GLI diagram"></center>
<p>
To assess the effects of light level on the number of seeds that survive, this behavior calculates the GLI at the center of each grid cell in the <a href="../grids/dispersed_seeds_grid.html">Dispersed Seeds grid</a> at the height specified in the <b>Height in m At Which to Calculate GLI</b> parameter (value is in meters).  The calculation proceeds exactly as described in the <a href="../light_behaviors/index.html">Light Behaviors</a>.  In order to perform these GLI calculations, this behavior requires its own copy of the key GLI setup parameters.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to use <a href="../disturbance_behaviors/storm_damage_killer.html">storms</a> in your run, this behavior can take into account the fact that storm-damaged trees may have different light extinction coefficients.  These light extinction coefficients are specified in the <b>Light Extinction Coeff of Complete Damage Trees (0-1)</b> and <b>Light Extinction Coeff of Medium Damage Trees (0-1)</b> parameters.
</p>
<p>
Once GLI has been calculated, the proportion of seeds that survive for a given species is calculated as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If GLI &lt; GLI<sub>opt</sub>, LE = 1 - (S<sub>lo</sub>(GLI<sub>opt</sub> - GLI))</li>
<li>If GLI = GLI<sub>opt</sub>, LE = 1</li>
<li>If GLI &gt; GLI<sub>opt</sub>, LE = 1 - (S<sub>hi</sub>(GLI - GLI<sub>opt</sub>))</li>
</ul>
<p> 
where
</p>
<ul>
<li>GLI is the GLI at the center of the <a href="../grids/dispersed_seeds_grid.html">Dispersed Seeds</a> grid cell at the height in the <b>Height in m At Which to Calculate GLI </b> parameter</li>
<li>GLI<sub>opt</sub> is the <b>GLI of Optimum Establishment, 0-100</b> parameter</li>
<li>S<sub>lo</sub> is the <b>Slope of Dropoff Below Optimum GLI</b> parameter</li>
<li>S<sub>hi</sub> is the <b>Slope of Dropoff Above the Optimum GLI</b> parameter</li>
</ul> 
<p>
Once the proportion of seeds that survive at the given GLI has been calculated, this value is multiplied by the number of seeds to reduce them by the proper amount.  The new reduced number of seeds is put back in the Dispersed Seeds grid.
</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
Apply this behavior to seeds of your desired species. Any species to which it is applied must also have a <a href="../disperse_behaviors/index.html">Disperse behavior</a> applied.  Storm damage is optional.
