<h1>Conspecific Tree Density Dependent Seed Survival</h1>
<p>
This behavior assesses seed survival as a function of the local density of conspecific trees. This behavior is very similar to <a href="#density">Density Dependent Seed Survival</a>.
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Conspecific Tree Minimum Neighbor Height (m)</td><td> The minimum height, in meters, of conspecific neighbors to include in local density calculations.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Conspecific Tree Search Radius (m)</td><td> The radius, in meters, to search for conspecific neighbors to include in local density calculations.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Slope of Density Dependence</td><td> The slope of the density dependence function for determining how many seedlings establish per square meter (c in the equations below).  </td></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Steepness of Density Dependence</td><td>  The steepness of the density dependence function for determining how many seedlings establish per square meter (&#948; in the equations below).  </td></tr>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
This behavior takes the seeds that have been dispersed to each grid cell of the <a href="../grids/dispersed_seeds_grid.html">Dispersed Seeds grid</a> and calculates how many will survive. The survival probability is a function of the density of conspecific neighbors. 
</p>
<p>
The density of conspecific neighbors is the number of stems per square meter of trees above the height set in the <b>Conspecific Tree Minimum Neighbor Height (m)</b> parameter, within the radius set in the <b>Conspecific Tree Search Radius (m)</b> parameter.
</p>
<p>
The number of seeds that survives is calculated as
</p>
<br><center><i>R<sub>sp</sub> = S<sub>sp</sub> * exp(-c * Den<sub>sp</sub><sup>&#948;</sup>)</i></center><br>
<p>
where:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>R<sub>sp</sub></i> is the number of surviving seeds of a given species in the seed grid cell</li>
<li><i>S<sub>sp</sub></i> is the original number of seeds of that species in that grid cell</li>
<li><i>Den<sub>sp</sub></i> is the density of conspecific neighbors (number per square meter) of that species in that grid cell</li>
<li><i>c</i> is the <b>Slope of Density Dependence</b> parameter</li>
<li><i>&#948;</i> is the <b>Steepness of Density Dependence</b> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once the number of surviving seeds has been determined, the behavior assigns that number back to the Dispersed Seeds grid cell.
</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>Apply this behavior to seeds of your desired species. Any species to which it is applied must also have any <a href="../disperse_behaviors/index.html">disperse behavior</a> applied.</p>
