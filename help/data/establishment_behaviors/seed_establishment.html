<h1>Seed Establishment</h1>
<p>
This behavior converts seeds into seedlings.
</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>This behavior goes through each grid cell in the <a href="../grids/dispersed_seeds_grid.html">Dispersed Seeds grid</a> and, for each species to which this behavior applies, converts each seed into a seedling. The seedlings are randomly placed within the grid cell area and have a slightly randomized value of <a href="../tree_parameters.html">New seedling diameter at 10 cm</a>.
</p>

<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>
Apply this behavior to seeds of any species. A species to which this is applied must also have a <a href="../disperse_behaviors/index.html">Disperse behavior</a> applied.
