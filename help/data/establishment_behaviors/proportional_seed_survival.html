<h1>Proportional Seed Survival</h1>
<p>
This behavior reduces the number of seeds by a set amount.
</p>

<h3>Parameters for this behavior</h3>
<table class="parlist">
<tr><th class="parname">Parameter name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td class="parname">Proportion Germinating Between 0 and 1</td><td> The proportion of seeds of a species that survive germination, as a value between 0 and 1. </td></tr>

</table>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>In each cell of the <a href="../grids/dispersed_seeds_grid.html">Dispersed Seeds grid</a>, this multiples the number of seeds present by the <b>Proportion Germinating Between 0 and 1</b> parameter, reducing the total number available.  The new number of seeds is placed back in the Dispersed Seeds grid.
</p>
<h3>How to apply it</h3>
<p>Apply this behavior to seeds of any species. Any species to which this is applied must have a <a href="../disperse_behaviors/index.html">Disperse behavior</a> applied as
well.</p>
