<h1>Set up grid save options</h1>
<p>
This window is reached from the <a href="detailed_output_setup.html">Setup detailed output file window</a>.  It allows you to choose options for <a href="../using/what_is_a_grid.html">grid</a> data for a <a href="../files/detailed_output_files.html">detailed output file</a>.  Each grid has different data associated with it, so you must choose them separately.  You choose each piece of data you want to save, and how often you want to save it.  You can work through the process below as many times as you like until you have your settings the way you want them. For a guide on how to set up output, see the <a href="../using/output_strategies.html">Output strategies</a> topic.
</p>
<p>
<b>Select a grid</b>.  Choose one of the current run's active grids from this drop-down list.  The grids that appear in that list depends on the list of <a href="../using/what_is_a_behavior.html">behaviors</a> for this run (editable using the <a href="model_flow_window.html">Edit simulation flow</a> window).  If none of the behaviors with which a grid is associated are enabled, then the grid won't show up in the list.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Save every X timesteps</b>.  Choose how often, in timesteps, you want to save this grid's data.  The number 1 saves every timestep.  The number 0 saves only the first and last timesteps.  Any other number X saves data every X timesteps.  
</p>
<p>
<b>For this grid save</b>.  Choose the data to save for this grid.  Ctrl + click to select multiple items.  For an explanation of what each grid's data is, see the <a href="../data/grids/index.html">individual grid documentation</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Add</b>.  Use the Add button once you have chosen your data and how often you wish to save it.  
</p>
