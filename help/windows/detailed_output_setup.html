<h1>Setup detailed output file window</h1>
<p>
This window is reached from the <a href="output_setup_window.html">Output setup window</a>.  It is the first step in setting up a <a href="../files/detailed_output_files.html">detailed output file</a>. For a guide on how to set up output, see the <a href="../using/output_strategies.html">Output strategies</a> topic.
</p>
<p>
<b>Output file name</b>.  Enter your output file name here.  You can use the "Browse" button to help you enter a path.  If you don't use a path your file may be hard to find.  Detailed output files end up with a ".gz.tar" extension. It is very important that your output file name not have the same name as your parameter file.
</p>
<p>
<b>Save everything</b>.  This saves all possible data.  The resulting detailed output file will probably be quite large.  This option is handy when you are still tweaking your parameter file.  You can save everything, run for a few timesteps, and review the data.  This option is also a good one when you wish to have the complete state of the model at every timestep, perhaps to use as input to new runs.

<b>Clear everything.</b>  Erases all detailed output settings.
