<h1>Model flow window</h1>
<p>
This window is reached using the main SORTIE window menu option "Edit->Model flow".  It allows you to choose the <a href="../using/what_is_a_behavior.html">behaviors</a> for a run, put them in a particular order, and assign them to trees.  The current behaviors and their tree assignments are displayed in a hierarchical structure.  You can view the data in three structures ordered by different hierarchies so that you can quickly find the information you want.  Clicking on different parts of the structure bring up windows to edit those options.
</p>
<p>
You will find that there are multiple ways to find, view, and edit the same information.  Once you have experience with this window, you may use different methods to edit behaviors depending on the nature of the edit you need to do. 
</p>  
<p>
This window has the following options:
<br>View by behavior
<br>View by data - species first
<br>View by data - type first
</p>

<h2>View by behavior</h2>
<p>
This button changes the view to a hierarchical structure that shows behaviors at the top level.  Each behavior for the current run is listed in order.  Expanding the tree under a behavior shows the grids and trees to which it applies.  Clicking on the name of any behavior brings up the <a href="run_behaviors_window.html">Current run behaviors window</a>, where you can edit the list of behaviors, their order, and to what trees they apply.  Clicking on any grid name brings up the <a href="grid_setup_window.html">Grid setup window</a>, where you can set options for grids.  Expanding trees shows you the tree types to which the behavior is assigned, first by tree type and then by species.  Clicking on a species name brings up the <a href="tree_behavior_window.html">tree behavior window</a>, which you can use to set up the behaviors applied to the chosen tree type and species combination.
</p>

<h2>View by data - species first</h2>
<p>
This button changes the view to a hierarchical structure that shows grids and trees at the top level.  In the tree structure portions, species is shown at a higher level and tree type (life history stage) is shown beneath.  Expanding a tree or grid branching shows what behaviors, in order, apply.  Clicking on any grid name brings up the <a href="grid_setup_window.html">Grid setup window</a>, where you can set options for grids.  Clicking on a tree type below a species name brings up the <a href="tree_behavior_window.html">tree behavior window</a>, which you can use to set up the behaviors applied to the chosen tree type and species combination.  Clicking on the name of any behavior brings up the <a href="run_behaviors_window.html">Current run behaviors window</a>, where you can edit the list of behaviors, their order, and to what trees they apply.
