<h1>Output setup window</h1>
<p>
This window is reached using the "Edit->Output options" choice on the menu of the main SORTIE window.  It is a gateway to managing the output options for a run.  What you save for output depends on what data you want to be available to you after the run.  For a guide on how to set up output, see the <a href="../using/output_strategies.html">Output strategies</a> topic.
