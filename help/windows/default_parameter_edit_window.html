<h1>Parameter edit window</h1>
<p>
This is the default window for editing the values for a single behavior.
</p>

<h2>Editing values</h2>
<p>
Edit values as you would in a spreadsheet program. You can copy and paste back and forth from Excel, and within the parameter window itself. You can use the menu commands on the parameter window "Edit->Copy" and "Edit->Paste", or the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl-C for copy and Ctrl-V for paste.
</p>

<!--<h2>Saving the values to a file for review</h2>
<p>
You can save the parameter window you are currently viewing as a tab-delimited text file for your own reference. Choose "File->Save window as file". You can then open the file you have saved in any spreadsheet or text editor program. The file that you save cannot be used as input to SORTIE.
</p>-->

<h2>Error messages when you click "OK"</h2>
<p>
When you click "OK" in the parameter window, the data in the window is checked to make sure it is complete and valid. If there is a problem, you are given an error message and the opportunity to correct the problem. You are not allowed to save invalid data changes. For more on what an individual piece of data is and what limitations may be placed on it, consult the individual behavior documentation.
