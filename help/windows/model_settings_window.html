<h1>Model settings window</h1>
<p>
This window is reached using the menu option "Edit->Model Settings" from the main SORTIE window.  It allows you to edit the parameter values for your run. 
</p>
<p>
The options you are given depend on what behaviors have been selected for the <a href="model_flow_window.html">model flow</a>. Options for the plot and tree populations are always available.
</p>
<p>
Each behavior has its own setup button. By default, this opens a window for entering parameter values. For those behaviors that need specialized setup, this button will open the appropriate window.
