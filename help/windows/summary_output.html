<h1>Summary output file setup window</h1>
<p>
This window is reached from the <a href="output_setup_window.html">Output setup window</a>.  It allows you to set options for a <a href="../files/short_output_files.html">summary output file</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Output File Name</b>.  Enter your output file name here, or choose the "Browse" button to navigate to a path.  If you do not enter a path, the file may be hard to find after the run.  The extension that will be added, if you haven't added it already, is ".out".
</p>
<p>
<b>Set up subplots...</b>.  Opens the <a href="edit_subplots_window.html">Edit Subplots</a> window.
</p>
<p>
The other options allow you to choose saving options for different types (life history stages) of both living and dead trees. Click here for more on <a href="../using/output_trees.html">saving live vs. dead trees</a>. For the definition of seedling, sapling, adult, and snag, and the difference between living and dead trees, see the <a href="../using/tree_life_history_stages.html">tree life history stages</a> topic. If you choose information for dead trees, you must select which mortality reasons you are interested in. If you do not save information for a particular mortality reason, it will not show up in the output even though there may be trees that died for that reason. All mortality reasons are always listed, although a particular run may not kill trees for that reason. Check the documentation for your chosen <a href="../data/disturbance_behaviors/index.html">disturbance behaviors</a> and <a href="../data/mortality_behaviors/index.html">mortality behaviors</a> for more information on which codes will apply to your run.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Save absolute density</b>.  Saves the density of trees of each species of that type, in number per hectare.
</p>
<p>
<b>Save relative density</b>.  Saves the density of trees of each species of that type, as a proportion of total tree density for that type.
</p>
<p>
<b>Save absolute basal area</b>.  Saves the amount of basal area of trees of each species of that type, in square meters per hectare.
</p>
<p>
<b>Save relative basal area</b>.  Saves the amount of basal area of trees of each species of that type, as a proportion of total tree basal area for that type.
</p>
<p>
<b>Select all</b>. Selects all check marks for both live and dead trees.
