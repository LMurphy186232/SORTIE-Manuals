<h1>Edit Scheduled Storms Window</h1>

<p>
This window is reached from the Edit menu by selecting "Scheduled Storms". It allows you to schedule storms for the <a href="../data/disturbance_behaviors/storm_disturbance.html">Storm disturbance</a> behavior. See that behavior's documentation for more on how scheduled storms work.
</p>
<p>
<b>Year of storm (not timestep):</b> The year the storm should occur.
</p>
<p>
<b>Storm minimum severity (0-1):</b> The minimum severity of the storm.
</p>
<p>
<b>Storm maximum severity (0-1):</b> The maximum severity of the storm.
</p>
<p>
After entering the data for a storm, click the "add" button to add it to the list. The order of the storms on the list does not matter since they each have a time associated with them. To remove storms from the list, select one or more and click "Remove".
