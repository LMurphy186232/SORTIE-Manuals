<h1>Edit Harvest Window</h1>
<p>
This window is reached by clicking the setup button for <a href="../data/disturbance_behaviors/harvest.html">Harvest</a> from the <a href="model_settings_window.html">Model setup window</a>.
</p>
<p>
This window is where you design all your harvest events for a run. You can create new harvest events and edit existing ones. This base window displays the current set of harvests.
</p>
<p>
At the top of the window are two buttons for scrolling through harvests that have been defined. On the left is information about the currently displayed harvest. On the right is a map of the plot. On this map is displayed the plot grid cells to which a harvest is applied. In addition, if there has been a tree map defined, existing trees are also displayed.
</p>

<h2>Creating and editing harvests</h2>
<p>
Click the "New" button to create a harvest. To edit an existing harvest, display it, then click "Edit". A window will be displayed where you can enter harvest data. 
</p>

<h2>Entering data about the harvest</h2>
<p>
<b>Timestep.</b>  Enter the timestep in which you wish the harvest to occur.  You can create more than one harvest per timestep.
</p>
<p>
<b>Select species...</b> This opens a window for selecting the species to which this harvest is to apply. Put a checkbox next to each desired species. If a species is not checked, no trees of that species will be cut.  You can cut the same species more than once in a timestep, but if the cut areas of the two harvests overlap, there is no attempt to consolidate them and you may not get the results you expect.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cut type.</b>  Select the type of cut you are performing.  The cut type makes no difference to the way that trees are selected for harvest.  Its main effect is to change the <a href="../data/substrate_behaviors/substrate.html">substrate</a> composition of the plot.  If you want to select multiple size classes for cutting, select "Partial cut".
</p>
<p>
<b>Cut amount type.</b>  This only applies if you have selected "Partial cut" under "Cut type".  Enter how you intend to specify the amount to cut in each size class you want to cut.  The same cut amount type applies to all size classes.</p>  
<ul>
<li><b>% of density.</b>  You intend to specify cut amounts as a percentage of total density to remove, from 0 to 100.  The trees removed will be randomly distributed between the minimum and maximum diameters in the size class.  For small tree populations, the amount actually removed may not be exactly what was entered.</li>
<li><b>Amt. density (#/ha).</b>  You intend to specify cut amounts as a number of trees per hectare to remove.  SORTIE will calculate the actual number of trees to remove by multiplying this number by the area to which the harvest is applied.  The trees are removed in size order, starting with the tallest in the size class, until the target number has been reached or there are no more trees in that size class.</li>
<li><b>% of basal area.</b>  You intend to specify cut amounts as a percentage of total basal area to remove, from 0 to 100.  SORTIE will add up the basal area in the size class in the cut area and take the percentage in order to figure out how much to cut.  SORTIE will work its way down the trees in the cut area in size order, removing each one that brings the amount of basal area removed closer to the target amount without going over.  If the size class range and the cut area are both large, the amount of basal area removed is likely to be very close to the target. 
<li><b>Amt. basal area (m<sup>2</sup>/ha).</b>  You intend to specify cut amounts as an amount of basal area to remove, in square meters per hectare.  SORTIE will calculate the actual amount of basal area to remove by multiplying the cut amount by the area to which the harvest is applied.  SORTIE will work its way down the trees in the cut area in size order, removing each one that brings the amount of basal area removed closer to the target amount without going over.  If the size class range and the cut area are both large, the amount of basal area removed is likely to be very close to the target. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Diameter Range(s) to cut.</b>  Enter the size class ranges you are cutting.  You must enter at least one, but in order to enter more than one, you must specify "Partial cut" under "Cut type".  For each size class, enter the minimum and maximum DBH, and the amount to cut in that range.  The units of amount to cut will depend on what you have entered in "Cut amount type".  Cut ranges may not overlap.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tree cut order.</b> Whether you want to cut trees tallest to shortest or shortest to tallest. Does not apply for gap or clear cuts, or percentage of density cuts.
</p>
<p>
<b>Prioritize trees...</b> This opens the <a href="prioritize_trees_window.html">window</a> to enter harvest priorities, if desired. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Set seedling mortality.</b> Use this button to open a window to enter the mortality percentage, as a value between 0 and 100, for seedlings for this harvest. 
</p>

<h2>Choosing the area to which to apply the harvest</h2>
<p>
To specify the plot area to which to apply the harvest, select the appropriate cells on the map. Cells default to 8 meters by 8 meters, but you can change this (see below). Selected cells will show up in color, and unselected cells will be white.  You can click and drag to mark out an area, or click on individual cells.  Clicking or dragging on selected (colored) cells causes them to become unselected (white).
</p>
<p>
You can display existing harvests, mortality episodes, and planting events in the plot area to help you match designs.
</p>

<h2>Changing grid cell size</h2>
<p>
The grid cell size for all harvests defaults to 8 m by 8 m. You can change the grid cell size using the "Change grid cell size" button. There is only one universal grid cell size for all harvests in a run. If you change the resolution, any harvests that have already been defined will be updated to the new resolution.
