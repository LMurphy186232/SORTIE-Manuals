<h1>Tree assignments window</h1>
<p>
This window is reached from the <a href="run_behaviors_window.html">Current run behaviors window</a> or from the <a href="edit_harvest_interface_window.html">Edit harvest interface window</a>.  It modifies the <a href="../using/how_trees_are_organized.html">trees</a> to which a <a href="../using/what_is_a_behavior.html">behavior</a> is applied.
</p>
<p>
The current list of tree species/type combinations is shown on the right-hand side of the window.  The left-hand side allows you to choose a new species/type combination.  Choose the appropriate combination where it says "--Please choose a species" and "--Please choose a tree type".  Then click the button marked ">>" to add your choice to the list.
</p>
<p>
You can remove a choice by selecting it in the list on the right, then clicking the "Remove" button.
</p> 
<p>
Not all behaviors can be assigned to all species/type combinations.  If you have made an invalid choice, you will see an error message when you click the "OK" button, and you will be given the opportunity to change it.  See the documentation for individual behaviors for information on how they can be applied.
