<h1>Prioritize Trees To Cut Window</h1>
<p>
This window is reached from the <a href="edit_harvest_window.html">Edit Harvest Window</a> by clicking on the "Prioritize trees..." button. This is where you enter data on how to prioritize trees to harvest.
</p>
<p>
You can define up to three priorities.
</p>
<p>
In the left-most box, select the <a href="../data/tree_data_member_list.html">tree data member</a> to prioritize by. The options in the box depend on the behaviors currently selected for the run. The data member may not apply to all trees being harvested. In this case the priority will be quietly ignored for those trees and they will be treated as non-priority.
</p>
<p>
Once you have selected the data member, select the range of acceptable values. Values are inclusive. To set only one allowed value, set both the minimum and maximum to this value. Acceptable values for boolean-type data members are 0 for false and 1 for true.
