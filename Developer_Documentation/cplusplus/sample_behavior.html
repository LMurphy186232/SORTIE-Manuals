This is a set of files called "MyBehavior.cpp" and "MyBehavior.h", with code for the class "clMyBehavior".  It tells you where to put your code to create a new behavior.  This code is not guaranteed to compile; it is just a guide.

<br>The slash and two asterisks, closed by an asterisk and a single slash, denotes a comment for automatic documentation by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen.</a>  You are politely requested to comment your header files in Doxygen format, so that they can automatically go into the overall SORTIE documentation.  The Doxygen web site has more on how to do that, and there are examples throughout this header file and in existing SORTIE code.  (See the <a href="../java/sortie_help.html">SORTIE help</a> topic for more on SORTIE documentation.)  Doxygen's C++ output for SORTIE is <a href="../c_doc/index.html">here</a>, if you want to see what it looks like.  Put this comment immediately before your class declaration. 
<br>
<br>Each behavior (in fact, each population and grid as well) has a name string.  This string is a unique identifier.  Other objects can use the name string to find and access this one.  So document your name string where it can be seen.  If you don't want other objects to access your code, don't skip the name string; just seal up your data.  This behavior's name string will be "my behavior".
