<h1>C++ Interface</h1>
<p>
You can bypass the Java interface when working with the C++ core.  This is very useful when debugging.
</p>
<p>
To access the interface, build the project that contains the interface and then run "coremodel.exe" (probably from a debugger).  The welcome screen should appear in a DOS window.
</p>
<p>
To add a file, type "input " + the filename.  If the file reads correctly, the following appears:
</p>
<p>
Model Status:  Ready to run.
</p>
<p>
To run, type "run".  If you want to specify a number of timesteps to run, you can type the number after the word "run."  To enter another file, type "input " followed by the path and name of the parameter file. 
</p>
<p>
For a list of all commands, type "help".  To end, type "quit".
</p>
<p>
Sometimes the interface traps debugger commands. In this case launch coremodel with the name of the parameter file as an argument.
