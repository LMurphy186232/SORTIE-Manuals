<h1>Java C++ Communication</h1>
<p>
Java communicates with the C++ core through the Java Native Interface (JNI).  The JNI has very picky requirements for the C++ function style, which are included in the file JNIFunctions.h compiled into the DLL.  There's lots of information on JNI on the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">Java website</a> and I would be happy to discuss it further if anyone needs to 
set up new functions.
