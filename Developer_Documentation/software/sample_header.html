<h1>Sample behavior header</h1>
<p>
This header is for our sample biomass calculation behavior, with notes on how to write for other behaviors.  This code is not guaranteed to compile; it is just a guide.  Our class name is <code>clSampleBehavior</code>, so our filenames should be "SampleBehavior.h" and "SampleBehavior.cpp".
</p>
<h3>SampleBehavior.h</h3>
<code>
<br><b>#ifndef SampleBehaviorH</b>
<br><b>#define SampleBehaviorH</b>
<br>
<br><b>#include "BehaviorBase.h"</b>
<br>
<br><i>/**
<br>The slash and two asterisks, closed by an asterisk and a single slash, denotes a comment for automatic documentation by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen.</a>  The Doxygen web site has a manual, and there are examples throughout this header file and in existing SORTIE code for how to comment in Doxygen format.  (See the <a href="../java/sortie_help.html">SORTIE help</a> topic for more on SORTIE documentation.)  Doxygen's C++ output for SORTIE is <a href="../c_doc/index.html">here</a>, if you want to see what it looks like.  Put this comment immediately before your class declaration. 
<br>
<br>Now to document what this behavior actually does.  This behavior calculates biomass for adult trees according to the following equation:
<br><center>B = a * DBH<sup> d</sup></center>
<br>where:
<ul>
<li>B = biomass in metric tons</li>
<li>a = slope of biomass equation</li>
<li>DBH = tree's DBH, in cm</li>
<li>d = exponent of biomass equation</li>
</ul>
Biomass is totaled in a grid object created by this behavior, called "Biomass Map".  Each cell in biomass map contains the average biomass for all adult trees in that cell.
<br>
<br>Each behavior (in fact, each population and grid as well) has a name string.  This string is a unique identifier.  Other objects can use the name string to find and access this one.  So document your name string where it can be seen.  If you don't want other objects to access your code, don't skip the name string; just seal up your data.  This behavior's name string will be "sample biomass behavior".  Call it in the parameter file (if it were real) with the string "sample biomass behavior".
