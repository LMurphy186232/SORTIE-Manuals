<h1>How a run progresses</h1>
<p>
A run is controlled entirely by the Simulation Manager object (class <a href="../c_doc/classclSimManager.html">clSimManager</a>). The Simulation Manager object is responsible for creating and destroying all other objects and for triggering each timestep's actions.  For more on the specific classes, see <a href="../cplusplus/cplusplus_architecture.html">Model Architecture</a>.

Here is a diagram showing the basic steps which happens during a run:

The Java interface does not deal directly with the Simulation Manager object; it just launches the C++ executable.
